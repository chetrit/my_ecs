## Usage

To start you have to create a registry :


```bash
ecs::registry_t r;
```

and then add all components that you will used in your registry (here an example with velocity component):

```bash
r.register_components<ecs::pos_t, ecs::velocity_t>();
```

Her, you can create an entity and add a component (ex: velocity_t) to this entity:

```bash
ecs::entity_t entity = r.spawn_entity();
r.emplace_component<ecs::velocity_t>(entity, 2, 2);
```

You can get an array of component like this in given wanted component:

```bash
auto &velocities = r.get_components<ecs::velocity_t>();
```
